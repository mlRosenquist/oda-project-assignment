The classification and visualization of the data is implemented in python and the source code can be found on \href{https://github.com/mlRosenquist/oda-project-assignment/tree/master/source}{github} and in the attached zip folder. The primary packages used are \href{https://scikit-learn.org/stable/index.html}{sklearn} for data analysis and classification and \href{https://matplotlib.org/}{matplotlib} for data visualization. The steps for each classification are: 

\begin{enumerate}
    \item Loading and reshaping data. 
    \item (ORL only) split train and test data
    \item Tuning relevant hyperparameters using \href{https://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/generated/sklearn.model_selection.GridSearchCV.html}{GridSearchCV}
    \item Fit model with train data
    \item Predict test labels with test data
    \item Output performance in logs and perform data visualization
\end{enumerate}
