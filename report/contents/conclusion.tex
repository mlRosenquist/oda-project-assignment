This thesis showed how various supervised learning algorithms can handle the Image Classification problem. Resulting in varying results for two different datasets. Reducing the amount of features led to lower accuracies but reduced the training time drastically. Certain algorithms performed better on one data set while others performed better on the different data set. The reduced features allowed data visualization and it was shown how certain algorithms make their decision boundaries.
